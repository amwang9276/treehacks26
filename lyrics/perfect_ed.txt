I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
Darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
I found a woman
Stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams
I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love
To carry more than just my secrets
Carry love, to carry children
Of our own
We are still kids and we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Mm, sing with me, yeah
Baby, I'm (sing) dancin' in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
Oh, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
