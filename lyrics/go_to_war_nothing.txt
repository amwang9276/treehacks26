I don't know what you had in mind
But here we stand on opposing sides
Let's go to war
Let's go to war
We arm ourselves with the wrongs we've done
Name them off one by one
Let's go to war
Let's go to war

Everything you say
Everything you do
You push it in
And you cut me down
And you cut me down
(War! War! War!)

Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

Hush my baby; make no sound
Maybe we can wait each other out
It's a cold war
Let's go to war
With every settled score
I thought that fighting with meant fighting for
But you turn it around
But you turn it around
(War! War! War!)

Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?

Do we censor, do we flow?
Are we drunk on the chemicals?
Every feeling in my bones tells me to lash out
And tell you to fuck off
You've got my heart
And I've got your soul
But are we better off alone?
With every battle, we lose a little more
Remember everything that we'd die for
You are everything that I'd die for

Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Screaming at the ones we love
Like we forgot who we can trust
Screaming at the top of our lungs
On the grounds where we feel safe
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe? Do we feel safe?
Do you feel safe?
