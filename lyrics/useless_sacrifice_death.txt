Fate is over, open your eyes
There is no hope, no second chance
All the elders saw, the fall of the sky
Pride and glory
To touch the sky we've burned the earth
Built our own infirmity
We chained our mind, crucified our heart
I walk in this burning desert without reason
There's nothing left unless their lies
Beyond the dust of the fallen kings' empires
Buried with their lust
Useless sacrifice
Flowing from the church the sheep are lost and run away
Betrayed by their trust
Useless sacrifice
All just useless sacrifice
I saw your wars
Your conquests and your doom
A civilisation who forgot to live
I saw your child, greedy to replace you
The planet turns but the men fall
The men fall
Until the end I will wait my turn
Waiting for someone who lets it burn
All the masks fall there is no place for lies
We burn earth in useless sacrifice
Until the end I will wait my turn
Waiting for someone who lets it burn
All the masks fall there is no place for lies
We burn earth in useless sacrifice
Waiting my turn
Someone who lets it burn
All the masks fall there is no place for lies
We burn earth in useless sacrifice
Son, drop your shield and watch the sky
Your agony, your last goodbye
Forget your anger
Watch the earth, your body belong to the ground
